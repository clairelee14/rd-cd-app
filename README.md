# rd-cd-app
reader's digest code igniter app
I used the same concept of creating a list of books as my top-books-rd repo but more so like GoodReads, you were able to login into an account and create a list of favourites on top of only being able to edit and delete books that you uploaded and only able to view the ones that other accounts uploaded.
There is a chart feature as well, using the add-chat-codeigniter plug-in.
